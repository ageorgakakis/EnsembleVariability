# EnsembleVariability


This project provides routines to model the ensemble excess variance of AGN using as input emprical relations and quantities. These inlcude the stellar mass function of galaxies, the specific accretion-rate distribution of AGN, the black-hole mass vs stellar-mass scaling relation and the Power Spectrum Density of the AGN flux variations. The flow-chart below shows how these components are combined to make predictions on the ensemble excess variance of AGN populations.
